      <h1>Ningal Ethra Best ❤️</h1>
      <p>
        Dear Head Office Madam,<br><br>
        There’s so much I could say, but none of it would ever fully capture how special you are to me. Watching you be the person you are—so kind, so thoughtful, so steady in the way you love and care—it’s honestly one of the greatest joys of my life.<br><br>
        You make things better just by being in them. My days, my thoughts, my world—they're all brighter because of you. I admire the way you carry yourself, the way you love your people, the way you quietly keep growing and giving your best to everything you do.<br><br>
        You’re not just the person I care about, you’re the person I look up to. The way you love, the way you give without asking, the way you push forward with so much grace—it’s honestly inspiring. You’ve taught me so much without ever trying to.<br><br>
        More than anything, I just want you to know how proud I am of you. Of the way you live, the way you give, the way you are. You’re not just loved—you’re deeply respected, appreciated, and held close in ways I probably don’t say enough.<br><br>

      <h2>Sophia Rout: Best Daughter and Sister</h2>
      <p>She gives without being asked, helps without being told, and loves without condition. The kind of daughter every parent is grateful for—and the kind of sister who’ll roast you one second and defend you the next. It’s love, always. Loud, honest, and unshakable.</p>

She's not just a good human — she's the best one you’ll ever meet.</p>

      <h2>Sophia Rout: Best Singer</h2>
      <p>She’s not the loudest in the room, but her voice is a soft thread in the song—sweet, steady, irreplaceable. Without her, it just doesn’t sound right. And when she sings, everything fits. The harmony, the warmth, the magic—it’s all her.</p>

      <h2>Sophia Rout: Best Muse</h2>
      <p>If I could turn every thought of you into music, this would be the playlist. It’s your 20th birthday, so here are 20 songs that remind me of you. There’s a little story in each of these 20 songs. Some are about you. Some are about how I feel because of you. Some hold a special memory of you. All are for you.<br>
